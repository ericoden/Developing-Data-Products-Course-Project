Code for the course project for the Developing Data Products course, part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered on Coursera.

The project is to create a reactive Shiny app that does something interesting as well as a pitch, written with Rstudio Presenter, that explains the app.

The app can be used here: https://ericoden.shinyapps.io/iris_identifier/
