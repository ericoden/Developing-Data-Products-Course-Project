Code for the course project for the Developing Data Products course, part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered on Coursera. The project is to create a reactive Shiny app that does something interesting as well as a pitch, written with Rstudio Presenter, that explains the app.

I chose to develop a multinomial logistic regression classifier for the famous [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) data set.
