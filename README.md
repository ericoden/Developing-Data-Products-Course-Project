# Iris Identifier

Code for my submission for the course project for the Developing Data Products course, part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered on Coursera. The project is to create a reactive Shiny app that does something interesting as well as a pitch, written with Rstudio Presenter, that explains the app. I chose to develop a [multinomial logistic regression classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression) for the famous [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) data set.

* The [pitch](https://rpubs.com/drsnowbunny1234/803778), hosted on RPubs.
